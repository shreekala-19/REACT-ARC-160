# React Arc 160
This repository is a part of my personal coding journey — React Arc 160, where I’m documenting my complete hands-on learning of React from Day 1 to Day 160.

Every folder inside represents a new day — a small milestone in my React learning arc. From the basic setup and JSX to complex concepts like hooks, context API, routing, and state management — I’m building everything step by step while learning how real-world React projects are structured and deployed.

This isn’t just a course or a challenge — it’s my daily commitment to improve as a developer, refine my logic, and build the discipline it takes to stay consistent in tech.
